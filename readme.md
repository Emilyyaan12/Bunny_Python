## Pitch
Hello my name is Emily and this is my partner Dina. We created this product called Bunny Python, it's a game that can help users learn or review the knowledge of python coding, for everyone, to spread diversity in the field of computer science and specifically reach out to those who want to explore what coding in Python is like in a game version. It is unlike yes or no game and Ixl (learning game) because our game is a combination of both, it has features from the two products which makes it an innovative educational game. Everyone should use our product because it helps users review or learn about the Python coding language while having fun, which can make learning more enjoyable. We are passionate about this because we believe that this game will provide the user both support and knowledge about the basics of Python. For the future, we would like to implement/develop/make other programming languages and add new features like choosing the questions' difficulty and background themes.
